		<h3>Portable Solar Power Inverter</h3>
		<p>By this project, we will be talking about solar power inverter, in which they are widely used nowadays. We have implemented and designed a portable solar power inverter that is used to convert the solar energy received from the sun by the cells of the solar panel which represents a Direct current input (DC) and converts it to alternating current (AC). This basic function of the solar panels is to produce DC electricity, and the lead acid battery stored it in the same form (DC). For that, all types of solar systems need a solar inverter, in which it converts the DC input into an AC. The aim of this project, is to explain more about the solar inverter that is implemented and designed, using low-cost components that are available everywhere.</p>
